# CEPWA2_2025
CEP Physics SImulation Weighted Assessment Project PathFinder Formulae Project

This is my CEP WA2 Project to see. Have taken inspiration from some common CP algorithms and Physics formulae and have integrated them to find a pathfinding cell/particle simulation.

This is my game documentation + reflections + inspirations I have taken from: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1794H3bc8Uwcu5fpRavJY1aFo6ACmTzwDzFn9YdRA-70/edit?tab=t.0 

Please do enjoy
