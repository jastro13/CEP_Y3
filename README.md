# CEP_Raffles Institution_ 2025

CEP + Physics Simulations for all 4 Weighted Assessment + Final Project. First project was a typeracer game, second was a PathFinder Formulae Project. Third is currently ongoing (simplified version of an astrophysics simulation) using both Newtonian Classical Physics & Relativity.

Have taken inspiration from some common CP algorithms and Physics formulae and have integrated them to find a pathfinding cell/particle simulation.

This is my ultimate portfolio + game documentation + reflections + inspirations I have taken from.

Please do enjoy lol :)
